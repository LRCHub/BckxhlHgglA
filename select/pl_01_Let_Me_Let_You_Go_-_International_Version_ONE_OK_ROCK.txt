Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
Bullets in the dark
Shootin' through
my hesitating heart
We were never gonna go far
'Cause I'm no good
at loving someone as good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can't undo this
I'm black and blue
to tell the truth
It's breakin' me,
I'm not just losin' you
I'm losin' what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd
never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you—
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
Wish you me made me stay
Wish you didn't let me run away
Guess you know
that I would never change
'Cause I'm no good
at lying 'cause someone
as good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can't undo this
I'm black and blue
to tell the truth
It's breakin' me,
I'm not just losin' you
I'm losin' what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd
never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you—
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear I tried
But how can I love you
if you're not here?
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear I tried
I tried, I tried to love
It's breakin' me,
I'm not just losin' you
I'm losin' what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd
never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you—
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
Oh, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
Oh
